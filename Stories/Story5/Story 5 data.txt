Story 5 – Daisy Dukes Disaster

Headline:
“Daisy Dukes Gone Wrong”

Sub-Caption:
“Caller says class is dead at Walmart”

Summary:
A caller unleashes on women wearing Daisy Dukes, tube tops, and Spanx in public, saying it makes him “want to vomit.” He rants about attitudes, Tinder profiles, and claims “thick thighs save lives” is false advertising.

Witness Ideas:

Cletus Ray – Walmart greeter who says he’s seen things no man should.

Tammy Jo – defensive shopper who says “I’ll wear what I damn well please.”

Big Earl – buddy who swears “it’s a free show, quit complaining.”

Shonda Mae – woman in Daisy Dukes who claims “men can’t handle confidence.”

Ronnie “Red Dot” Jenkins – guy who can’t stop laughing retelling the scene.

Teleprompter Script:

“Our final story tonight takes us to the fashion battlefield known as Walmart. The caller says he can’t stomach one more round of Daisy Dukes stretched across waistlines big enough to register their own zip code. According to him, it’s not just the shorts — it’s the tube tops, the Spanx, and the confidence that comes with it.

The caller swears these outfits aren’t just crimes of fabric — they’re killing his appetite, his marriage, and his will to live. And when confronted, he says, the wearers double down with attitude, daring anyone to look away.

So here’s what we’re left with: a man scarred by butt cheeks, belly rolls, and Walmart aisles that look more like a carnival sideshow. Call it confidence, call it delusion, but one thing’s certain — it ain’t thick thighs saving lives. It’s Little Debbie keeping business booming.”
