Story 4 – Maintenance Tech vs. Shop Workers

Headline:
“Stop Being Jerks At Work”

Sub-Caption:
“Caller says share tools, stop excuses”

Summary:
A maintenance worker says shop guys give outsiders a hard time instead of helping. Says they should loan tools, stop making excuses, and quit being jerks when someone comes in to fix equipment.

Witness Ideas:

Earl Wayne – traveling tech who says he’s sick of hostile shops.

Jimmy Don – in-house mechanic who thinks outsiders are “taking his job.”

Sue Ann – secretary who overhears the arguments and rolls her eyes.

Big Al – foreman who says “quit crying, just fix it.”

Timmy – rookie who just wants the tools to work.

Script:
“Fourth story tonight — a traveling maintenance tech says shop workers need an attitude adjustment. According to him, when he shows up to fix equipment, the in-house crew treats him like the enemy instead of the solution.

The caller says it’s simple: stop being jerks, hand over the tools, and quit with the excuses.

So what do we have? A traveling tech ready to get the job done, and a shop full of guys guarding their wrenches like family heirlooms. At the end of the day, the machine’s still broke, and everybody’s too busy pouting to turn it back on.”
