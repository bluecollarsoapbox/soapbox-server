Story 1 – Crawl Space vs. Concrete

Headline:
“Crawl Space Crew Explodes”

Sub-Caption:
“Caller says concreters can’t count”

Summary:
A crawl space worker rants that concrete crews overpour slabs by absurd amounts, burying plumbing and waterproofing and proving they “can’t count past shapes and colors.”

Witness Ideas:

Billy Ray “Crawl King” – veteran plumber, flashlight in one hand, cigarette in the other.

Carl Wayne – concrete guy defending the pour, but can’t explain the math.

Tammy Jo – neighbor who just heard screaming and assumed someone died.

Little Ricky – rookie apprentice who thinks crawl spaces are “haunted anyway.”

Big Earl – equipment operator who says “concrete covers a multitude of sins.”

Script:
“First up tonight — straight from under the house. A crawl space worker says the concrete crew can’t count. When the job calls for six feet, they pour a hundred. Not a footing, more like a crypt.

The caller says these guys never made it past shapes and colors, and math is nowhere on the jobsite. Pipes can’t go in, waterproofing’s useless, and what should be a crawl space looks more like a sealed tomb.

[WITNESS CAMEO CUT IN HERE]

So here’s what we’re left with: plumbers buried alive, crawl spaces turned into catacombs, and concrete crews out here playing connect-the-dots with the wrong numbers. Someone bring a calculator before another trade loses their mind.”
